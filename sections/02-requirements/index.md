# Requirements

## User stories

In today's world full of technology, people often ignore that issues don't only come form the outside, but they can be oart of the problem, too, if not the problem itself. They are always concerned about major - and legit - problems in digital devices and technolgoies. First of all is probably security and privacy. 

Human beings daily interact with many services and/or products which require, trivially, a username and a password for identification and authentication purposes, but all experts keep suggesting to make up passwords that significantly differ from one another since, without discussing too much technicality, it is one of the best practices we can apply to better safeguard our accounts and personal information. The consequent risk is that people who would like to be compliant with this practice may risk to forget their passwords. One solution they might opt for is transcripting their passwords in a notebooks or even a piece of paper they stick, for instance, on the computer. Finding cybersecurity a very valuable discipline, we thought about trying to develop a quite essential desktop application which any kind of user could be able to use, encountering the basic needs involved in password management and providing an idoneous security level. 

We would not suggest this application for important levels of business, like adopting it as main system in a bank, jobs related with public security and so on. It would definitely require more security barriers, while we implemented for sure a strong encryption protocol, yet was it intended to offer a tool to private users or employers at lower business levels who are not daily exposed to serious attacks. It goes without saying that hackers and malicious users may be more interested in causing discomfort to relevant and well-known organizations, institutions and personalities rather than focussing on ordinary people.

## Requirements analysis

- The requirements must explain **what** (not how) the software being produced should do.
    - You should not focus on the particular problems, but exclusively on what you want the application to do.
- Requirements must be clearly identified, and possibly numbered.
- Requirements are divided into:
    - **Functional**: some functionality the software should provide to the user.
    - **Non-functional**: requirements that do not directly concern behavioral aspects, such as consistency, availability, security, efficiency, etc.
    - **Implementation**: constrain the entire phase of system realization, for instance by requiring the use of a specific programming language and/or a specific software dependency.
        - These constraints should be adequately justified by political / economic / administrative reasons (which must be written down)...
        - ...otherwise, implementation choices should emerge *as a consequence of* design (and therefore described in the design section).
- If there are domain-specific terms, these should be explained in a **glossary**.
- Each requirement must have its own **acceptance criteria**.
    - These will be important for the validation phase.
