## User stories

In today's world full of technology, people often ignore that issues don't only come form the outside, but they can be oart of the problem, too, if not the problem itself. They are always concerned about major - and legit - problems in digital devices and technolgoies. First of all is probably security and privacy. 

Human beings daily interact with many services and/or products which require, trivially, a username and a password for identification and authentication purposes, but all experts keep suggesting to make up passwords that significantly differ from one another since, without discussing too much technicality, it is one of the best practices we can apply to better safeguard our accounts and personal information. The consequent risk is that people who would like to be compliant with this practice may risk to forget their passwords. One solution they might opt for is transcripting their passwords in a notebooks or even a piece of paper they stick, for instance, on the computer. Finding cybersecurity a very valuable discipline, we thought about trying to develop a quite essential desktop application which any kind of user could be able to use, encountering the basic needs involved in password management and providing an idoneous security level. 

We would not suggest this application for important levels of business, like adopting it as main system in a bank, jobs related with public security and so on. It would definitely require more security barriers, while we implemented for sure a strong encryption protocol, yet was it intended to offer a tool to private users or employers at lower business levels who are not daily exposed to serious attacks. It goes without saying that hackers and malicious users may be more interested in causing discomfort to relevant and well-known organizations, institutions and personalities rather than focusing on ordinary people. 

- Write down [user stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) to devise the main __personas__ (user roles) and the activities they will perform via the system to be developed.

## Requirements analysis

The requirements observed to build the application can be divided into functional, non-functional and implementation needs. The former imply some functionality the software should provide to the user, while the non-functional are requiremnts that do not directly concern behavioral aspects (e.g., consistency, availability, security, efficiency). Implementation stuff involves constraints for the entire phase of system realization (e.g, requiring the use of a specific programming language and/or a specific software dependency). 

The **FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS** involve: 
| ID  | Requirement |
|-----|-------------|
| F1  | The system must allow the user to set and use a **master password** to gain access to private data. |
| F2  | The system must allow the user to **add a new entry**, consisting of: website name, URL, username, email, and password. |
| F3  | The system must allow the user to **modify an existing entry**, including one or more fields (e.g., password change). |
| F4  | The system must allow the user to **delete an entry** when it is no longer needed. |
| F5  | The system must allow the user to **import entries** from existing files. |
| F6  | The system must allow the user to **export entries** to a file. |
| F7  | The system must allow **duplicate entry prevention** to avoid inserting the same site entry twice. |
| F8  | The system must **validate input** so that the required fields (sitename, URL, username/email) are not empty before saving. |
| F9  | The system must allow **initial setup** by creating required database schema and tables. |
| F10 | The user must **create and confirm a master password** during initial configuration. |
| F11 | The system must allow users to **retrieve entries** by providing one or more fields (sitename, URL, email, username). |
| F12 | Passwords should be automatically **copied to clipboard** when retrieved to preserve secrecy. |
| F13 | If no email is provided when adding an entry, it must **default to an empty string**. |
| F14 | The system must provide a **graphical login window** with username and password fields and a submit button. |
| F15 | The system must allow the user to **press Enter** to submit login. |
| F16 | The system must inform the user of login **(success or) maybe I just want failure because the success is visible** failure through **popup messages**. |
| F17 | After login attempt (success or failure), input **fields must be cleared** for security. |

NF10 is checked when copying to clipboard does not last forever yet has a time limit to safeguard passwords' secrecy.<br>
NF11 is checked when, if something is missing in the row, the system prints an explicit error message identifying which field is missing, or eventually lists multiple missing fields and stops the operation if it is incomplete but does not crash.<br>

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
I1 is checked when entries are stored in a structured database file (not just temporary memory).<br>
I2 is checked when database queries (insert, update, delete, select) work using SQL syntax.<br>
I3 is checked when the source code of the application is implemented in Python.<br>
I4 is checked when the verification of the code shows AES-256 encryption is applied when saving passwords.<br>
I5 is checked when the system uses PBKDF2 as the key derivation function, SHA-512 is explicitly used as the hash function in PBKDF2, the derived key length matches the required AES key size (e.g., 32 bytes for AES-256), the derivation process correctly combines the master password and the device secret (salt) and using the same master password and device secret produces consistent keys on repeated derivations.<br>
I6 is checked when the generated device secret respects the parameters.<br>
I7 is checked when the two tables are correctly created at initial setup and contain all needed fields.<br>
I8 is checked when, on startup, the application attempts a connection to a MySQL (or SQL-compatible) database with host set to localhost<br>
I9 is checked when the app accepts commands passed through CLI (e.g., python pm.py add -s sitename -u url -l username -e email), flags (e.g., -s, -l) are parsed correctly, the system provides a help text (--help) and if a user omits required arguments, the system displays clear error messages without crashing.<br>
I10 is checked when a generated/retrieved password is automatically copied to clipboard, the user is notified of that, the password stays in the clipboard until replaced or cleared by the user/system, the application does not expose the password on-screen unless explicitly requested. If the clipboard functionality fails, an error message gets displayed.<br>
I11 is checked when the whole GUI is created by means of the quoted Python library.<br>
I12 is checked when message boxes showed on display to send visible warnings to the user adopt tkinter formats.<br> 

# POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE REASONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
I1 Databases provide scalable and cost-effective storage compared to flat files, they make backup, auditing, and access management easier. Ensures compliance with privacy and data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).<br>
I2 SQL databases are widely available and free/open-source, lowering costs. Staff and developers are already familiar with SQL, reducing training effort. SQL is a well-established industry standard, reducing risk of vendor lock-in.<br>
I3 Python is free and open-source, reducing licensing costs. It flatters a large community support and abundant libraries speed up development and maintenance. Python is widely accepted in government, academia, and industry for secure applications.<br>
I4 Using a well-tested open algorithm avoids costs of proprietary solutions and reduces risk of breaches (which are financially damaging). It simplifies audits and certifications since AES-256 is widely recognized by IT security standards. AES-256 is an international encryption standard, endorsed by organizations like NIST, ensuring compliance with security policies.<br>
I9 Increases trust and transparency, reduces maintenance costs, since future developers won’t need to rewrite argument handling (using a standard library like argparse is cheaper than custom parsers), having standardized CLI parsing makes the tool easier to maintain, document, and test.<br>
I10 Aligns with privacy and security regulations, improves user experience and productivity (fewer failed logins, faster workflows), simplifies daily workflow for users.<br>
I11 and I12 comprehend a public and easy-to-retrieve and user-friendly library available on Python that just needs to be imported in the project code, no additional costs or license.<br>

    
        **- ...otherwise, implementation choices should emerge *as a consequence of* design (and therefore described in the design section).**
- If there are domain-specific terms, these should be explained in a **glossary**.
